2. What is Asset renting/Leasing?
- Asset Leasing is a contractual agreement between the owner of the assets (lessor) and the user of the assets (lessee), whereby the owner permits the user to use the asset against payment in the form of lease rent for a specific period of time. The title of goods remains with the owner (lessor) of the asset until the tenure is completed and will be transferred to Settlrs.

4. Who will carry ownership of the asset I purchase? ( What happens to the asset after the tenure ends?)


- The Assets will be owned by the investor throughout the investment duration. At the end of the duration, the transfer of assets will automatically happen to Settlrs.

So if you break down the monthly rental return, it will consist of Interest + Principal Amount + Residual value return of the Assets!

11. On what basis is an investment opportunity enlisted with Settlrs?


Settlrs was a business before the introduction of the Alternative Asset Leasing Platform, and hence it has always focused on building a healthy relationship with the diversified clientele it has worked with through the years. So most of the tickets listed with us will be from trustworthy clientele who we have already worked with.


Since this is only business-to-business, our evaluation process is strict, and we perform due diligence on all parameters, such as:


1. Finances: Analysis and assessments of their annual reports in order to understand scale, economics, growth of the business, profitability patterns, the current and past cash positions of the business, and the outstanding debts and loans;
2. Business Performance and Consistency: Reviews of the key contracts, industry trends, assets, consistency in product development, ROI over time, and OEM quality in order to enable an estimation of the future performance of the lessee;
3. Corporate Profile: Professional backgrounds of the Founders, ongoing litigations, shareholders, cross verification with customers and other stakeholders.
4. Expansions: Analysis of the expansions of the business and growth and sales cycles to know productivity and future growth trends.


12. Can I invest more than one time?
- Yes, you can invest in more than one asset. We encourage diversification, and it is always a sign of a healthy investment portfolio.


13. What is the Difference between IRR vs. ROI?
- The internal rate of return, or IRR, is a metric that is used in financial analysis in order to estimate the profits of potential investments. It is a discount percentage that enables the net present value of the cash flows to equal zero with the discounted cash flow analysis. What it means is that the INR 100 that we currently hold today is worth more than the INR 100 that we receive after three months, taking inflation into account.


Whereas ROI is the percentage of the increase or decrease of investment from beginning to end. Revenue Over Income is calculated by taking the distinction between the current and the expected future value, and then dividing it by the original value, and multiplying by 100. 


15. Is a Nominee mandatory during investments?
- Yes, it is mandatory. You will have to provide the nominee details while registering on the platform and completing KYC. 


16. What is the Refund and cancellation policy of Settrs investment?
- Once the documents have been signed and the investment process is complete, there can be no cancellations/ terminations/ refunds made back to the investor. The tenure should be completed.


17. What are the Tax Implications?
- Lease income is taxed at the tax slab of an individual. You can also book depreciation as a business expense against this lease income to reduce the tax burden.


18. Do investors need to complete their KYC first to E-sign their agreement?
- Yes, completing KYC is a mandatory step post which an investor can go ahead with their investment process.


19. Is signing the agreement compulsory?
- Post the payment process, the actual digital signing of the agreement is initiated. Failing to do so, the contract would become null and void leading to the payment being refunded back to your account in 7 working days and hence the cancellation of the whole investment opportunity.


20. What are the tax reductions on monthly returns?
- TDS applicable as per tax norms for each slab.
